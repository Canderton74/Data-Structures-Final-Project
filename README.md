# Data-Structures-Final-Project

## General Roadmap
 - Together, write a really general outline of the Data structure class: Function prototypes for how each person will interact with it
 - Together, write a more specific function outline showing how the actuall dataset will be loaded, and how to access it.
 - Each person works individually on their subsection of the Project, adding to or changing the Data structure as needed

## Front end download infrastructure
- Download node.js from https://nodejs.org/en
- Make sure to add 'C:\Program Files\nodejs\' to your PATH environment variables for your computer
- Pycharm should automaticlaly pick up the node.js and npm paths
- If pycharm doesn't you can add this in your files settings

 ## Running the front end
- To run the frontend, go to the terminal on pycharm and navigate to the "my-app" directory
- run the command "npm start" and you should be directed to a url that runs the frontend
