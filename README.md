# Data-Structures-Final-Project

## General Roadmap
 - Together, write a really general outline of the Data structure class: Function prototypes for how each person will interact with it
 - Together, write a more specific function outline showing how the actuall dataset will be loaded, and how to access it.
 - Each person works individually on their subsection of the Project, adding to or changing the Data structure as needed
